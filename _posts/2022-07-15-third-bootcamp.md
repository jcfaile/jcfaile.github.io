Problems
======

Problem 2 (Prelim August 2011)
------
Give an explicit description of all conformal self maps of $\Omega = \mathbb{C} \setminus \\{0\\}$. Do the same for $\Omega = \mathbb{C} \setminus \\{z_1,\dots, z_n\\}$
<details>
	<summary>Hint</summary>
		Show that at any of the $z_k$ a conformal self map must have either a removable singularity or simple pole. Deduce that the map must be the restriction of a MÃ¶bius transformation to $\Omega$. 
</details>

Problem 1
------
Determine all bijective conformal self maps of $\Omega = \\{z: |z| > 1 \\}$. 
<details>
	<summary>Hint</summary>
	Conjugating such a map by $z\mapsto 1/z$ phrases this problem on this disk minus a point. 
	Can you extend this map to the whole disk?
