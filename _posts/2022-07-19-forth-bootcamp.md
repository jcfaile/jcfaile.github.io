Problem 1 (Prelim August 2015)
------
Let $f$ be a nonconstant meromorphic function satisfying $$f(z) = f(z+\sqrt{2}) = f(z+i\sqrt{2})$$ and assume $f$ has at most a single pole in $\mathbb{D} = \\{z: |z| < 1 \\}$. 
a. Show that there must exist a pole in $\mathbb{D}$. 
<details>
	<summary>Hint</summary>
	If there is no pole in $\mathbb{D}$ how many poles can $f$ have elsewhere?
</details>
b. Show that this pole cannot be simple.
